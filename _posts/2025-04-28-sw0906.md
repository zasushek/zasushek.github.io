# sw0906 - Steganography Write-up

## Challenge Overview
In this steganography challenge, we were provided with a file named `yoda`. The objective was to uncover a hidden flag within the file. The file's unusual format and the hint in its name suggested that we needed to dig deeper to reveal its secrets.

## Initial Analysis
I started by downloading the file and inspecting it. The file lacked a proper extension, so I used the `file` command to determine its type:

```bash
file yoda
```

The output indicated that the file was recognized as `data`, implying that it wasn't a standard file format or had an incorrect structure:

This suggested that the file's format was either corrupted or deliberately obfuscated, a common tactic in steganography challenges.

## Examining Magic Bytes
To identify the true file format, I checked the file's **magic bytes**—the initial bytes that serve as a signature for specific file types. A comprehensive list of file signatures can be found on [Wikipedia's List of File Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures).

Using a hex editor (`hexedit`), I inspected the first few bytes of the file:

The bytes appeared similar to those of a JPEG file (`FF D8 FF`), but something was off—each group of four bytes seemed to be inverted. For comparison, I checked a valid JPEG file's magic bytes:

The inversion pattern reminded me of the file's name, `yoda`, which evoked Master Yoda's distinctive inverted speech pattern from Star Wars (e.g., "Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you."). This clue suggested that the bytes might have been deliberately rearranged.

## Reversing the Byte Order
Hypothesizing that each group of four bytes was reversed, I wrote a Python script, with slight assistance from AI, to swap the order of every four-byte chunk in the file. The script reads the original file, reverses each group of four bytes and writes the corrected data to a new file:

```python
input_file_path = 'yoda'
output_file_path = 'yoda_swapped'

def reverse_bytes_in_groups_of_four(data: bytes) -> bytes:
    corrected = bytearray()
    for i in range(0, len(data), 4):
        group = data[i:i+4]
        corrected.extend(group[::-1])
    return bytes(corrected)

with open(input_file_path, 'rb') as infile:
    original_data = infile.read()

corrected_data = reverse_bytes_in_groups_of_four(original_data)

with open(output_file_path, 'wb') as outfile:
    outfile.write(corrected_data)
```

## Results
After running the script, I obtained a new file, `yoda_swapped` and opened it with an image viewer. The image rendered correctly and revealed the hidden flag.

## Conclusion
This challenge cleverly used the theme of Master Yoda's inverted speech to hint at the byte-reversal technique. By recognizing the pattern in the file's magic bytes and writing a Python script to reverse each four-byte group, I transformed the obfuscated file into a valid JPEG image containing the flag. This task highlighted the importance of combining contextual clues with technical analysis in steganography challenges.

**Flag**: `CIT{h1dd3n_n0_m0r3_1t_i5}`

## Tools Used
- `file`: To check the file type.
- `hexedit` : To inspect the file's byte structure.
- Python: To write a script for reversing byte groups.
- Image viewer: To verify the corrected image.

## Tips for Similar Challenges
- Pay attention to file names or challenge titles for hints about the required technique.
- Use the `file` command to quickly identify discrepancies in file formats.
- Check magic bytes against known signatures to uncover the true file type.
- If bytes appear scrambled, consider patterns like reversal, especially when prompted by thematic clues.
- Python is a powerful tool for automating byte manipulation tasks in steganography.
